# Pre-Stakeholder Validation Checklist (ADR-010)

**Feature:** [Feature ID and Name, e.g., F02 - Chat Integration]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Validator:** [Agent Coder / Developer Name]
**Stakeholder:** [Stakeholder Name]

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: ADR-010 is NOT the final gate

**ADR-010 validates**: Demo works technically (no crashes, tests pass)
**Session Review validates**: Stakeholder approves the feature (meets requirements)

**After ADR-010 passes**:
→ **DO NOT COMMIT YET**
→ **NEXT STEP**: Present to stakeholder (Step 3 of Session Workflow)
→ **ONLY COMMIT**: After stakeholder gives explicit approval

**See**: `process/delivery/sprint/templates/session-review-checklist.md` for full workflow
