## 📊 Sprint Overview

### Sprint Goals

**Primary Goal**: [Main objective of this sprint - what value are we delivering?]

**Secondary Goals** (if applicable):
- [Goal 2]
- [Goal 3]

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 3]

## 📈 Capacity Planning

### Velocity Baseline

**Previous Sprint(s) Velocity**:
- Sprint [N-1]: [X] pts / [Y] sessions = [Z] pts/session
- Sprint [N-2]: [X] pts / [Y] sessions = [Z] pts/session (if applicable)

**Adjusted Velocity** (for this sprint):
- [X] pts/session (considering [factors: MVP vs Full, complexity, etc.])

### Capacity Calculation

**Sessions Available**: [N] sessions
- Frequency: [X] sessions/week × [Y] weeks = [N] sessions total
- Duration: [X-Y] hours per session (estimated)

**Projected Capacity**: [N sessions] × [X pts/session] = **[Total] story points**

**Buffer**: [±X%] for unknowns/risks

**Final Capacity Range**: [Min]-[Max] story points
